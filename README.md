This WIP mod for Balatro replaces elements of the game with stuff (sometimes only tangentially) related to the Ace Attorney Circlejerk community. Meant to be used alongside [BlueStorm](https://balatromods.miraheze.org/wiki/BlueStorm).

Download the mod by pressing the green "Code" button, then pressing "Download ZIP".

Thanks to betboxer for converting the mod to Malverk, and everyone in the AACJ Discord server who suggested ideas for cards!
